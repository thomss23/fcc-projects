                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                        (for example, a web browser),JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                   </p>
       
                   <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
                        control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
       
                   <ul>
                       <li>
                       Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
                       For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.      
                       </li>
       
                       <li>
                       Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                       provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                       </li>
                   </ul>
